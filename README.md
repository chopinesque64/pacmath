# Pacmath
In the spirit of [`haloweenmath`][haloweenmath], you can generate Pacman as a symbol and binary operator in ![equation][LaTeX].

## Acknowledgements
 - Dr. Cook, for his zany love of Pacman as a lecture aid.
 - G. Mezzetti, author of `haloweenmath`,  for his insight into defining custom operators.

The user-level commands and example document were minimally adapted from the [2016 Seasonal Challenge][question] that inspired `haloweenmath`.
